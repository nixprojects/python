# python

This repo will include projects I'm working on related to Python programs. The main resources that I'm using right now are both Codecademy's Python course, for the basics, as well as ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](http://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994?tag=duckduckgo-d-20).
